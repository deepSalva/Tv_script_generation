This exercice represents a Recurrent Neural Network for generate our own Simpsons TV script implemented in Tensorflow.

We'll be using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons, a subset of the original dataset. It consists of only the scenes in Moe's Tavern. This doesn't include other versions of the tavern, like "Moe's Cavern", "Flaming Moe's", "Uncle Moe's Family Feed-Bag", etc... The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.
